# About 

Over the past six years, as I embarked on my journey through engineering and later transitioned into the captivating realm of data science, I also passionately pursued other endeavors. I immersed myself in the world of direct sales, honing valuable communication and negotiation skills while promoting products I believed in. Additionally, fueled by my love for mathematics, physics, and chemistry, I embraced the role of educator, sharing my knowledge and insights in these subjects with others. The experience of guiding individuals through complex concepts and witnessing their growth in confidence and proficiency has been immensely rewarding. These diverse experiences, spanning six years, have not only enriched my professional repertoire but have also deepened my conviction in the power of shared knowledge to drive progress. Now, as I continue my journey in data science, I aim to integrate these passions and experiences to make meaningful contributions to the community and the world at large.
